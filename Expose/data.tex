The images have been resized by kaggle to be uniform in size. The dataset also contains an .csv file that annoates for each image if it contains an columnar cacti or not. The images are all from the Tehucan-Cuicatlan valley in the south of Mexico \cite{LOPEZJIMENEZ2019}. The images have been obtained using a drone from an flight altitude of 100 m.
