\section{Method}
In recent years, Convolutional Neural Networks have seen remarkable success in object classification~\cite{alexnet} and style detection~\cite{style}.
Similar to \citet{alexnet}, the number of different classes to choose from is huge (1103 distinct annotations).
However, unlike \citeauthor{alexnet}, where each image was classified as exactly one class, each artifact can have multiple annotations.
Nevertheless, we will likely use the a similar architecture as \citeauthor{alexnet}, since this enables us to use their pretrained convolutional layers.
