\section{Method}
For implementation we plan to use Python 3.7 with keras\cite{KERAS} and sciPY\cite{SCIPY}, in particular numpy and pandas.
As an extension of the project we look towards trying out different libraries, such as fast.ai\cite{FASTAI} and compare the different results.
% If we have enough time left at the end of the project we might also try different libraries and compare if we can get better results that way.
