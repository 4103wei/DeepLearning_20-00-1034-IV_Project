\section{Method}
In recent years, Convolutional Neural Networks have seen remarkable success in object classification~\cite{alexnet} and style detection~\cite{style}.
Similar to \citet{alexnet}, the number of different classes to choose from is huge (1103 distinct annotations).
However, unlike \citeauthor{alexnet}, where each image was classified as exactly one class, each artifact can have multiple annotations.
Nevertheless, we will likely use the a similar architecture as \citeauthor{alexnet}, since this enables us to use their pretrained convolutional layers, which will speedup training significantly.
To deal with the noise present within the annotations, we use the F2 loss since it favours recall over precision and is thus fairly robust to noisy labels:
\begin{equation*}
    \frac{(1 + \beta^2) pr}{\beta^2 p+r}\ \ \mathrm{where}\ \ p = \frac{tp}{tp+fp},\ \ r = \frac{tp}{tp+fn},\ \beta = 2.
\end{equation*}
