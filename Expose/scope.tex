\section{Goal}
The goal of this project is to establish a fundamental understanding of deep learning approaches in a practical sense. Therefor, in the context of this project, we plan to train a convolutional neural network, optimize its hyper parameters and study verification processes. Due to the nature of the data set, only containing data for columnar cacti (Neobuxbaumia tetetzo) we limit ourselves to using a binary classifier.
