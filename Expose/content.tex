\section{Motivation}
Object detection or object recognition is one of the most common problem across scientific fields. In the scope of this project we want to implement such a system. Under the pretext of entering the Kaggle competition, Aerial Cactus Identification, we want to study the fundamental practice of convolutional neural network (CNN). The goal of the competition is to assess the impact of climate change on flora and fauna. The sysytem VIGIA, an autonomous surveillance of protected areas, was build for the exact purpose. An important part of such as system is to be able to identify certain vegetation within the protected areas.
